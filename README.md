# My components
This is a collection of HTML and LWCOSS based components [`View Live`](https://aritram1.github.io/lwc-oss-my-components/)

# How to start?
Start simply by cloning the repo and running `npm install` followed by `npm run watch`. This will start the project with a local development server. 
The source files are located in the [`src`] folder. The web component (app) is within the [`src/client/modules`] folder. The folder hierarchy also represents the naming structure of the web components. The entry file for the custom Express configuration can be found in the [`src/server`] folder.

# Features
- Add different types of activities
- Embed as widget in another component
- More, WIP
